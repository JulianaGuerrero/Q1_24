Transportation cost analysis for Rwandan truckers

This project wants to understand how different factors affect the costs of transportation
in rural areas in Rwanda based on surveys collected with local truckers and the information
on their most recent trips.

The package includes the scripts for cleaning and preparing data for the analysis, and the
script where different models are fit.

Due to limitation to access private/personal data, the original data files can't be shared 
but a subset of these is left as output in order to run the models.
